XGCM Examples Binder
====================

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgcm/xgcm/master/doc/_static/logo.png" align="left">

This is a live session from which you can run notebooks on the cloud.
A file browser listing example notebooks is available to the left.

You can also launch [Dask](http://docs.dask.org) clusters to scale out the processing.
Dask dashboard plots are available to the right.  
These will activate when you launch a Dask cluster and start doing work.
(these cells are already written for you).

To get started, double click on one of the notebooks to the left,
and start running through the Jupyter notebook cells.
